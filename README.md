## __WARNING!__  
### __Before running this project, you need to run an endpoint from [this repository](https://github.com/Bravv0/junior-react-endpoint-master)__

This project fetches data from endpoint "localhost:4000" by default.

This is unfinished project, based on a test case.

For the test case, use of functional components is prohibited. Only class components.

That's why i use fetch API now to fetch data from GraphQL before i'll find the best way. 

Next steps: 
 * Create working shopping cart
 * Cart dropdown menu
 * Store selected products in local storage
 * Provide loaders
 * Improve routing


This project style based on this [template](https://www.figma.com/file/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-(Public)?node-id=150%3A1168)

In this project was not necessary to make adaptive markup, supporting mobile resolutions, only regular screen resolutions;

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
